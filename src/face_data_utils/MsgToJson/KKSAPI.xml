            Base type for custom game extensions.
            It provides many useful methods that abstract away the nasty hooks needed to figure out when the state of the game
            changes.
            
            This controller is a MonoBehaviour that is created upon registration in <see cref="M:KKAPI.MainGame.GameAPI.RegisterExtraBehaviour``1(System.String)"/>.
            The controller is created only once. If it's created too late it might miss some events.
            It's recommended to register controllers in your Start method.

            Do not use in TalkScenes, use <see cref="M:KKAPI.MainGame.EventApi.StartTextSceneEvent(TalkScene,System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{ADV.Program.Transfer},System.Boolean,System.Boolean)"/> instead.
            You can get variables set in the commands through actScene.AdvScene.Scenario.Vars.
            You can specify heroines you want to use in this script and use the CharaChange command to load their parameters. You can also use Program.SetParam to hard code the parameters in the list. 
            Warning: By default you need to have ScreenFadeRegulate and SceneFade commands at the start of your script, check fadeIn parameter description for more info.

            You also need to add a `SceneFade "out"` command at the start to fade out the effect and show the dialog (spawn characters and do all initialization before this step so it's not visible).
            At the end of the scene if you want to fade out then add a `SceneFade "in"` command at the end of your script (after closing it will fade back to the game automatically).</param>

            Do not use in TalkScenes, use <see cref="M:KKAPI.MainGame.EventApi.StartTextSceneEvent(TalkScene,System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{ADV.Program.Transfer},System.Boolean,System.Boolean)"/> instead.

            You need to use Program.SetParam if you want to add parameters related to a heroine. Alternatively use the CharaChange command with the global heroine syntax.

            <summary>
            Adds an interpolableModel with a dynamic parameter to the available interpolables list. This interpolable can then be instantiated by the user by adding a keyframe.
            The dynamic parameter means that every time user creates this interpolable, you can provide a different parameter - this allows having multiple instances of this interpolable for a single studio object. The instances are differentiated by the parameter, which must be unique and have a unique hash code (if the parameters have identical hashes they are treated as the same thing).
            Examples where this is useful: editing individual character bone positions/scales, changing color of individual accessories.
            If you want to make a global interpolable you can use AddInterpolableModelStatic instead.
            Try to keep the callbacks as light and self-contained as possible since they can be called on every frame during playback or UI usage (except the xml callbacks). If you need to find some object to later use in the callbacks, consider using it as the parameter (that way it will only be computed once and you can use it later for free, just make sure the parameter is always the same since if you have different parameters will create separate instances).
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Use cases:
            <list type="bullet">
            <item>To make a global interpolable (affects overall studio state) set <paramref name="useOciInHash"/> to false and don't provide unique parameters (or any parameters at all).</item>
            <item>To make a single interpolable per studio object (e.g. changing a character's hair color) set <paramref name="useOciInHash"/> to true and don't provide unique parameters (or any parameters at all).</item>
            <item>To make multiple interpolables per studio object (e.g. changing color of different clothing items) set <paramref name="useOciInHash"/> to true and provide unique parameters that represent the exact thing that is being changed.
            How this works: When user adds a new interpolable then</item>

            It's optional as long as you use a common simple value type like <see cref="T:System.Single"/> or <see cref="T:UnityEngine.Vector3"/> that has a deserializer available.

            <param name="getParameter">
            Get object/data to apply changes to.
            The main use of parameters is when you can have multiple instances of this interpolable on a single studio object - you can then use parameters to differentiate individual parts, e.g. bones.
            For example you can use the transform that this interporable will affect (set its position etc.) as a parameter - that way you can have separate interpolables for different transforms of the same studio object.
            This parameter will be passed to other callbacks, and it will be serialized and deserialized when saving/loading timeline data (serializing it is optional but without serializing the parameter you will lose it after scene reload).
            If you are using parameters, make sure to implement <paramref name="getFinalName"/> as well - it's used to give different names to interpolables based on the parameter (e.g. transform name).
            Note: Everything related to parameters is optional and can be skipped if you don't need multiple instances of the interpolable on a single studio object.
            Parameters should be hashable (hash should be stable during the game session).
            <example><code>((OCIChar)oci).GetChaControl().transform.Find("someBone")</code></example>
            </param>
            <param name="readParameterFromXml">
            Deserialize a parameter previosuly saved with <paramref name="writeParameterToXml"/>.

            </param>
            <param name="writeParameterToXml">
            Serialize the parameter to store it inside timeline data.
            It will be later deserialized with <paramref name="readParameterFromXml"/>.
            For example if you use a <see cref="T:UnityEngine.Transform"/> for your parameter, you can write its path or name if its unique, and then search for it when deserializing.
            <example><code>writer.WriteAttributeString("parameter", ((Transform)parameter).name);</code></example>
            </param>
            <param name="checkIntegrity">
            Check if the parameter and data are valid and can be interpolated.

            Class that specifies how a setting should be displayed inside the ConfigurationManager settings window.
            
            Usage:
            You can use this copy of the class instead of including it in your own plugin.
            Make a new instance, assign any fields that you want to override, and pass it as a tag for your setting.
            
            If a field is null (default), it will be ignored and won't change how the setting is displayed.
            If a field is non-null (you assigned a value to it), it will override default behavior.
            </summary>
            
            <example> 
            Here's an example of overriding order of settings and marking one of the settings as advanced:
            <code>
            // Override IsAdvanced and Order
            Config.AddSetting("X", "1", 1, new ConfigDescription("", null, new ConfigurationManagerAttributes { IsAdvanced = true, Order = 3 }));
            // Override only Order, IsAdvanced stays as the default value assigned by ConfigManager
            Config.AddSetting("X", "2", 2, new ConfigDescription("", null, new ConfigurationManagerAttributes { Order = 1 }));
            Config.AddSetting("X", "3", 3, new ConfigDescription("", null, new ConfigurationManagerAttributes { Order = 2 }));
            </code>
            </example>

            ChaReference.RefObjKey alternative that's safe to use in all versions of KK.
            Why: Everything below CORRECT_HAND_R changed its int value in darkness vs other versions of the game, so if you
            compile with darkness dll you will unexpectedly get a different enum value in games without darkness.
            This isn't necessary in KKS, but it does work in case your code targets both KK and KKS.
            Only values present in all game versions are provided (the lowest common denominator being KK without Dankness).

            It provides many useful methods that abstract away the nasty hooks needed to figure out when
            a scene is loaded or imported, or how to save and load your custom data to the scene file.
            
            This controller is a MonoBehaviour that is created upon registration in <see cref="M:KKAPI.Studio.SaveLoad.StudioSaveLoadApi.RegisterExtraBehaviour``1(System.String)"/>. 
            The controller is created only once. If it's created too late it might miss some scene load events.
            It's recommended to register controllers in your Start method.
